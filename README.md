**The Confluence of Forces (in the midst of change); Building dialogue to envisage a collective vision to celebrate the future.** Swaying in the midst of forces of confluence seems to be order of the day. It is affirming and blissful at times but at times, it can be the most difficult mile to tread. However, it is the propeller of energy, the transformer of time and may be the confirmation of lived experiences. All of us have our stake in it. No wonder why we strive to be in the midst of it. It is about our voice being heard, about our vision being seen and about our participation being valued. And most of it all it is about acknowledging the space, place, emotions, faith and the life & time we live in.
